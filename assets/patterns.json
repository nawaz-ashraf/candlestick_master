Traders use charts,\noften candlestick charts, to identify patterns, support\nand resistance levels, and trends that can help\npredict future price movements.\nYou\u2019ll learn: how to read a single candle, how short\nsequences of candles reveal turning points, and how\nlarger chart structures (triangles, head & shoulders,\nflags) form from repeated behavior. Most importantly,\nyou\u2019ll learn a simple trading discipline: define entry,\nstop-loss, and position size before you trade, and let\nthe market validate your plan. Practice steadily, keep\na journal, and expect steady improvement \u2014 price\naction rewards patience and clear rules.",

    "description": "What is Support in Trading?\nSupport in trading defines the price point where\ninvestors show buying interest to stop price declines.\nYou can use this technical concept to locate price\npoints which attract enough buying interest to stop\ndownward price movements.\nThe asset price tends to recover through upward\nmovement when it reaches this point because investors\nrecognize good value at this level.\nSupport is the opposite of resistance. Support functions\nas a price floor below the market value while resistance\nfunctions as a price ceiling above the market value\nbecause sellers use it to push prices down.\nIdentifying Support levels\nThe identification of support levels occurs through\nthe analysis of historical price charts which show\ninstances where prices stopped declining. The\nidentification of these key trading levels enables\ntraders to determine their entry points while deciding\nwhether to purchase or establish stop-loss orders.\nKey Points About Support:\nA strong support level indicates that a downtrend\nmight transition into an uptrend.\nSupport levels exhibit a non-static characteristic\nbecause they transform according to market\nconditions.\nSupport levels tend to match important\npsychological price points because investors tend\nto make decisions at these points.\nThe strength of support increases with each\nunsuccessful attempt of the price to penetrate\nbelow the level.\nWhat is Resistance in Trading?\nResistance in trading defines the price levels in\ntrading that sellers actively defend to stop price\nincreases. The technical concept enables traders to\nlocate price points where selling interest becomes\nstrong enough to drive prices downward.\nThe asset price encounters downward pressure at\nthis level because sellers consider it an optimal point\nto sell which may cause a price reversal.\nResistance is the opposite of support. Support is a\nprice floor below the market value, while resistance is\na price ceiling above the market value, where selling\npressure tends to push prices down.\nIdentifying Resistance levels\nThe identification of resistance levels requires\nstudying historical price charts to determine the points\nwhere prices failed to ascend. Traders use this\nknowledge to determine their sell order positions and\nstop-loss points.\nKey Points About Resistance:\nA strong resistance level means that an uptrend\nmay reverse into a downtrend.\nResistance levels are not fixed and can change\nbased on the market conditions.\nResistance often occurs at significant\npsychological price points where traders make\nkey decisions.\nThe more times the price fails to break through a\nresistance level, the stronger that resistance is\nconsidered.",
